</I am a theoretical linguist working in the Department of English Language and Literature. I joined NUS in 1993. Currently I have two active research areas: contact linguistics.I teach modules in English linguistics and in contact linguistics, at both undergraduate and graduate levels. My area of graduate supervision is broader, including Chinese linguistics and theoretical linguistics. In contact linguistics, I am interested in how a language acquires new grammatical features from the languages with which it comes into contact, and how social stigmatization affects the development of these new features. In phonology, I am exploring formal ways of capturing dialect diffusion.  >
