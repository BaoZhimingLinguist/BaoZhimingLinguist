## Hi there 👋

<!--
**BaoZhimingLinguist/BaoZhimingLinguist** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I am a linguistic professor at National University of Singapore.

- 👯 I am interested in collaborating on neurolinguistic research.



- ⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy driving through the villages in Malaysia during the holidays.
