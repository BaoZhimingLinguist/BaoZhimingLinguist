Hello,

<!--
**BaoZhimingLinguist/BaoZhimingLinguist** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ I am a linguistic professor at National University of Singapore.

- ðŸ‘¯ I am interested in collaborating on neurolinguistic research.



- âš¡ Fun fact: I enjoy driving through the villages in Malaysia during the holidays.
